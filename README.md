# Iris-Flower-Classification
This project classifies iris flowers into three species using four supervised machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The goal is to compare model performance using accuracy and visualize predictions with a confusion matrix.
