# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – 4 ML Models

📌 Project Overview

This project classifies iris flowers into three species using four supervised machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The goal is to compare model performance, understand feature importance, and predict new samples interactively.

⚠️ Note: The dataset is small and clean, so models may achieve very high accuracy. In real-world scenarios, cross-validation and larger datasets are recommended to avoid overfitting.
